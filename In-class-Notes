Container Orchestration 

Orchestration: Using a tool to manage the Lifecycle of a container

Orchestration provides 4 main features:
====================================
- Creation of multiple replicas using a single image
- Distribution those replicas on different VMs (cluster)
- Scaling up and scale down of replicas
- Ensure the desired count of replicas are always available
- Rolling update of the Image - Using a tool to delete container of old image and creating new containers of new Image


Kubernetes and Azure Kubernetes Service

Kubernetes:
=====================
It works in a Master and node setup
Kubernetes can be used to orchestrate containers of different container tools like docker, crio, container d and so on.
So before setting up Kubernetes we have to ensure CRI (container runtime interface) is available on each VM
We have to also setup CNI (container network interface)
Kubernetes support auto scaling of containers
The Kubernetes the container will always be scheduled on Worker node, commands of K8s will be executed on Master node.
IN K8s there are various controllers or objects that will help in orchestration activites
ReplicaSet
Deployment
Service
Jobs
PV

In Kubernetes the containers can preserve data outside the cluster also.
Kubernetes provides features of configMap and secrets
Kubernetes also has a GUI - Kubernetes dashboard
