Create Daemon Set in the cluster

kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sonal0409/Vodafone-Kubernetes-Notes/main/Day2-Notes/DaemonSetDemo/deamonset.yml

Validate if single pod is created on every worker node
kubectl get pods -o wide

You will see 2 pods have been created on each Node

kubectl get ds

A daemonset is created with desired pods as 2
Note:
If a new node is added to the cluster,a new pod will be created on the new node also. Desired count would have increased to 3.
